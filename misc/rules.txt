Game Rules:

1) Each player gets 3 rolls of 5 dice per turn
2) Player must get a 6 - ship 5 - captain 4 - crew in decending order each turn and the final 	   2 dice are used as cargo points. Note: Player must get a 6 before they can get a 5 before      they can get a 4, however, if a 6 and 5 rolled at the same time you can keep both.
	ex: Player rolls a 1 3, 6, 4, 2. The player would keep the 6 and reroll everything 		else. Next roll the player gets a 3, 5, 4, 4, the player would take the 5 and 4 for 		the captain and crew dice and then choose to reroll the 4 and 3 for cargo or keep them 	and receive a score of 6 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 22
